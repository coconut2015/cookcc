# Yacc Input #

CookCC Yacc input allows CookCC to read traditional yacc/bison input files.  However, there are some deviations since some features are not support by CookCC.

## Deviations ##

### Non-terminal name restrictions ###

The pattern of non-terminal names recognized by CookCC is `[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*`.

### Embedded actions are not supported ###

CookCC does not allow embedded action for yacc input at present.  The presence of such grammar would result in parsing error.

An embedded action is like the following:
```
	A	: B { /* embedded action */ } C
		  { /* regular action */ }
		;
```

It is equivalent to

```
	A	: B T C
		  { /* regular action */ }
		;
	T	:
		  { /* embedded action */ }
		;
```


### Token declaration works somewhat differently ###

In CookCC, tokens declared using `%token` are treated as non-associative terminals (same as `%nonassoc`).

In contrast, in yacc / bison, tokens by default have the lowest precedence can be specified later again in `%left`, `%right`, `%nonassoc` directives to specify the precedence and associativity.  CookCC does not allow tokens specified in `%token` directives to be specified in other token directives.

## Code Sections ##

The code surrounded by ` %{ ` and ` %} ` pairs in section 1 of yacc input are treated as `"fileheader"` code.

The section 3 code of yacc input are treated as `"default"` code.
