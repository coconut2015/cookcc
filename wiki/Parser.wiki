#summary CookCC Parser Documentation

= Parser =

Currently, the parser generator is in the process of implementation.  The generated parser is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser LALR(1)].

== Parser Table Format ==

Currently, the following table formats are supported.

|| {{{ecs}}} || Good when there are not a lot symbols and states. ||
|| {{{compressed}}} || A smaller table in most cases at some performance cost. ||

== Default Reduce ==

When this option is turned on, DFA states that contain a reduce state would convert all 0 entries to the reduce state.  This approach can make the compressed table more compact, at the expense of more difficult error recovery.

== Analysis Output ==

When the command line option {{{-analysis}}} is specified.  A file named [http://code.google.com/p/cookcc/source/browse/trunk/tests/java/parser/calc/cookcc_parser_analysis.txt cookcc_parser_analysis.txt] is generated in the current directory that contains the detail of the parser.  It can be useful in analyzing the grammar.
