= Introduction =

CookCC is intended to be a lexer and parser generator project, combined.  It is written in Java, but the [TargetLanguages target languages] can vary.  It uses a template approach to generate source codes, so it is quite easy to add a new target language.  CookCC also comes with a suite of [http://code.google.com/p/cookcc/source/browse/trunk/tests/ test cases] to assist creating and testing new target languages.

The input to CookCC is currently limited to an XML ([http://code.google.com/p/cookcc/source/browse/trunk/src/resources/cookcc.dtd DTD]) format.

Currently, the v0.1 release contains only the [Lexer lexer] generator.

The [Parser parser] generator is being worked on.  The main work left is the Java code generator.
