#summary Describes Yacc grammar input

= Yacc Input =

CookCC Yacc input allows CookCC to read traditional yacc/bison input files.  However, there are some deviations since some features are not support by CookCC.

== Deviations ==

=== Embedded actions are not supported ===

Yacc input does not allow embedded action.

An embedded action is like the following:
{{{
	A	: B { /* embedded action */ } C
		  { /* regular action */ }
		;
}}}

=== Token declaration works somewhat differently ===

In CookCC, tokens declared using {{{%token}}} are treated as non-associative terminals(same as {{{%nonassoc}}}).

In contrast, in yacc / bison, tokens by default have the lowest precedence can be specified later again in {{{%left}}}, {{{%right}}}, {{{%nonassoc}}} directives to specify the precedence and associativity.  CookCC does not allow tokens specified in {{{%token}}} directives to be specified in other token directives.

== Code Sections ==

The code surrounded by {{{ %{ }}} and {{{ %} }}} pairs in section 1 of yacc input are treated as {{{"fileheader"}}} code.

The section 3 code of yacc input are treated as {{{"default"}}} code.
