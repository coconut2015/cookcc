#summary Explains warnings generated by CookCC

== Backup ==

This situation happens when a pattern proceeds to match a relatively long string without intermediate states that are acceptable.

You can take a look at a simple [http://code.google.com/p/cookcc/source/browse/trunk/?r=155#trunk/tests/backup example] that cause such a problem.

Backups can cause slight performance degradations, depending the target language.  For Java, the difference is not so noticeable.

== Incomplete States ==

This situation happens when patterns concerning part of the character sets have been specified.  By default, CookCC internally add states that simply dumps the characters not matched by the user patterns to the standard output.

One way to avoid such warning is add a pattern {{{.|\n}}} as the last pattern for the state.  This is in fact the way internally CookCC does.

CookCC also requires user to specify {{{<<EOF>>}}} conditions for all states, just in case.

== Some Pattern Can Never Be Matched ==

By default, patterns specified earlier have precedence patterns specified later.  Thus, for some patterns, the matchable strings could always be matched by other patterns first.
