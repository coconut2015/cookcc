#summary Notes on Java Output

= Target Language : {{{java}}} =

Java is the default output language of CookCC.  It can also be selected using the
{{{-lang java}}}  command line option.

Currently, only the lexer component has been finished.

== Command Line Options ==

|| {{{-d <directory>}}} || Select the output directory.  By default, it is the current directory. ||
|| {{{-lexertable <format>}}} || Select lexer DFA table format.  Available choices are {{{ecs}}}, {{{full}}}, and {{{compressed}}}. ||
|| {{{-class <className>}}} || Set the class name.  By default, the class name is {{{Lexer}}}. ||
|| {{{-public}}} || set class scope to {{{public}}}.  By default, the class generated is in the package scope. ||

== Lexer ==

[http://code.google.com/p/cookcc/source/browse/trunk/tests/#tests/fastwc Word count tests] on large files (5 MB - 22 MB) have shown that {{{ecs}}} table has about the same performance as the {{{full}}} table for Java.

=== Unicode Support ===

CookCC can generate 16-bit tables.  However, due to the size of of the equivalent class table, Sun's Java compilers cannot handle it.  A work around is to use [http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/core/index.php ECJ (Eclipse Core Java compiler)] to compile the generated code.
