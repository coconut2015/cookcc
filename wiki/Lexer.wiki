CookCC Lexer has the following features.

== Lexer Table Format ==

CookCC supports DFA tables for 8-bit and 16-bit characters.  16-bit character tables are intended for unicode support.  Currently, the following table formats are supported.

|| {{{full}}} || A full table.  Very memory intensive. ||
|| {{{ecs}}} || A much smaller table using equivalent classes. ||
|| {{{compressed}}} || An even smaller table in most cases at some performance cost. ||

== Pattern Warnings ==

CookCC generates warnings on patterns that cause [http://code.google.com/p/cookcc/source/browse/trunk/tests/java/lexer/backup backup], patterns that were [http://code.google.com/p/cookcc/source/browse/trunk/tests/java/lexer/unreachable never reached], or states that have [http://code.google.com/p/cookcc/source/browse/trunk/tests/java/lexer/incomplete incomplete pattnerns].


== Trail Context ==

CookCC at present only handles either fixed head (e.g., abc/xyz or abc/x*z) or tail trail contexts (e.g., a.*b/xyz).

== TODO List ==

The following features are yet to be implemented:
|| yyMore || Make the current string available for the next time. ||
|| REJECT || Reject a token and go to the next available accept case. ||
|| Variable trail context || This feature is related to REJECT. ||
