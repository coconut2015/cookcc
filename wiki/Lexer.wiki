#summary Documentation for the CookCC Lexer

= Features =

CookCC Lexer has the following features.

== DFA Table Format ==

CookCC supports both 8-bit and 16-bit DFA tables.  16-bit DFA tables are intended for unicode support.

|| DFA Table Format ||
|| *full* || A full table.  Very memory intensive. ||
|| *ecs* || A much smaller table using equivalent classes. ||

Word count tests on large files (5 MB - 22 MB) have shown that *ecs* table has about the same performance as the full table.

== Pattern Warnings ==

CookCC generates full reports on patterns that cause backup, or patterns that were never reached.


== Trail Context ==

CookCC at present only handles either fixed head (e.g., abc/xyz or abc/x*z) or tail trail contexts (e.g., a.*b/xyz).
