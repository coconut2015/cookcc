{{{@CookCCOption}}} is used to mark a class that uses the generated lexer/parser.  In this case, we mark the {{{Calculator}}} class.

{{{
import org.yuanheng.cookcc.*;

@CookCCOption (lexerTable = "compressed", parserTable = "compressed")
public class Calculator extends Parser
{

}
}}}

The generated class is actually the parent class of {{{Calculator}}}, in this case, {{{Parser}}} class.  Since we haven't really generated this class yet, so what we needed to do to work on the {{{Calculator}}} class without the error in editor (assuming that you are using a decent Java IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA) is to create an empty {{{Parser.java}}} with the following code.

{{{
/* Copyright (c) 2008 by Heng Yuan */
import org.yuanheng.cookcc.CookCCByte;

/**
 * @author Heng Yuan
 * @version $Id$
 */
public class Parser extends CookCCByte
{
}
}}}

Notice that we have the file header (copyright notice) and the class header.  CookCC Java input will keep these in the generated class.
