# Error Recovery #

`<parser>` has an option `recovery` which would turn on/off the error recovery code depending whether or not the value is `true` or `false`.  This value is by default `true`.

Turning off error recovery can be useful since a lot of time we do not really care much about the corrupted data, and error recovery can be slow.

The exact behavior of error recovery depends on the specific implementation of output language.

## Error Recovery in Java ##

When the `recovery` option is set to `false`, the parser simply returns with a value of `1` to indicate that an error has occurred.

The option `parseerror` controls whether or not the code generator should generatet he `yyParseError` function.  Set this option to `false` if you want to the parser to use your own function.

Otherwise, the behavior of the parser is the following.

When a token not belonging to one of the lookahead (i.e. cannot either reduce or shift) is encountered.  `yyParseError` function is called.  If this function returns `true`, the parser stops and returns a value `1`.  If the function returns `false` (by default), an error token is pushed onto the lookahead stack and an internal error flag `_yyInError` is set.  Then the parsing is resumed.

If the error token can be shifted, then a grammar dealing with error recovery is found.  Otherwise, the parser would start discarding a state on the stack until a grammar that can handle the "error" token is reached.

With the error token shifted on to the stack.  The state should be immediately reduceable if the grammar does not require any tokens after the error token.  Otherwise, it means the grammar is looking for a specific terminal.  Then the input is continuously consumed until the desired token is found, or the end of file is reached.

Additionally, `yyPeekLookahead ()` is provided to check the cause of the error (only accurate if the user didn't specify any terminals after `error` in the grammar).  `yyPopLookahead ()` is provided to remove the possible offending token.  However, this function should be called only once.

Here are some [test cases](http://code.google.com/p/cookcc/source/browse/trunk/tests/java/parser/error/) that demonstrate these behaviors.
