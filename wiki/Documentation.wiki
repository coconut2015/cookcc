= Introduction =

CookCC is intended to be lexer and parser generator project, combined.  It is written in Java, but the [TargetLanguages|target languages] can vary.  It uses a template approach to generate source codes, so it is quite easy to add a new target language.  CookCC also comes with a suite of test cases to assist creating and testing new target languages.

The input to CookCC is currently limited to an XML (DTD) format.

Currently, only the lexer part has been implemented.
